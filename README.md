# Machine design

This is an experimental framework with the aim of using machine learning
for design tasks. 

According to the constructive machine learning workshop (see <http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztg/cml/2016/index.html>), possible design tasks include :

- chemistry (e.g. de novo drug design)
- biology (e.g. gene design, metabolic path design, RNA polymer design)
- computer science (e.g. automatic software generation, resource network allocation)
- art (e.g. music or poetry composition)
- gaming (e.g. character or level construction)
- education (e.g. personalized curricula design)
- services (e.g. personalized travel itinerary or insurance policy composition)
- layout design (e.g. urban planning, furniture arrangement, advertisement composition)
- alimentary (e.g. generation of novel food recipes or cocktails)
